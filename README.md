# Marks Collector & Total Calculator

A short Python script to take marks as input, store them in a list, and calculate the total.  
Perfect for beginners learning **loops**, **lists**, and **basic I/O** in Python.

## How It Works
- Prompts the user to enter the number of subjects.
- Takes marks for each subject one by one.
- Stores them in a list.
- Calculates and displays the total marks.

  

## Example
Enter the number of subjects: 3
Enter the marks for subject 1: 90
Enter the marks for subject 2: 85
Enter the marks for subject 3: 95

Marks on each subject: [90, 85, 95]
Total marks: 270
